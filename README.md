# Rehersal manager
This project is in development phase. It is meant to be a side project for a friend who is an actor and needs a tool to help them conduct rehersals better, faster and in a more efficient way.

Main purpose of the app is to allow user to mark actors who came to a rehersal and on that base output available scenes that can be played by these actors.

## Installation
`$ npm install`
or
`$ yarn install`

## Available Scripts
##### `$ npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

##### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

##### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

##### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup). We also recommend installing Genymotion as your Android emulator. Once you've finished setting up the native build environment, there are two options for making the right copy of `adb` available to Create React Native App:



##### `npm run eject`

This will start the process of "ejecting" from Create React Native App's build scripts. You'll be asked a couple of questions about how you'd like to build your project.
